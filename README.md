# workshop1-nietzsche


### Summary
We would like to apply data visualisation to philosophical texts so that we can create alternative ways to engage with philosophical concepts. The focus is on a known narrative in the philosophical sphere, that of the philosopher Nietzsche and his relationship with Schopenhauer.
Much of Nietzsche’s concepts are influenced by his admiration, and later disapproval of Schopenhauer. It remains a mystery how this happened so we want to visualize which negative terms associated with Shopenhauer’s name.
We think there is great potential in parsing philosophical texts into a visual format for greater understanding and learning that could only contribute to advancing our collective human knowledge.

### Audience
Anyone who would benefit from this alternative way of visually parsing philosophical texts, i.e., researchers, students, general population.

###Goals
Build a scraper to pull all the Posthumous Fragments from this website.
Find an appropriate sentiment analysis model to train with the scraped data. Ensure all ethical considerations are applied.
Visualise the data in a format that is first narrative, and second exploratory.


###About the data
The data is taken from Nietzsche Source (http://www.nietzschesource.org/#eKGWB/NF-1869,1). More details about the particular edition we are using can be found here.

### Inspiration / Examples
We have seen some works done on philosophical texts that drove our motivation to do more with this:
The most interesting was done in 2013 by the University of Milan and DensityDesign Research Lab called ‘Minerva’ (https://densitydesign.org/2013/08/minerva-data-visualization-to-support-the-interpretation-of-kants-work/) They looked at Immanuel Kant's most commonly used words across his published work. There were plans to develop an interactive tool but it was never published.
Another group used Wikipedia to find influences between philosophers and visualise this as a network graph (http://www.coppelia.io/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/philprettyv4.png). In this version, Nietzsche is shown as a large circle showing his heavy influence on other philosophers.
Another one (https://s4n0i.github.io/schoolofathens/) looked at the same relationships of influence as a network graph but placed on a timeline which better shows the historical influences. Github repo here (https://github.com/S4N0I/theschoolofathens).
